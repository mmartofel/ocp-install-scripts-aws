1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (oc).

2. You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:

oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"

If you see the following output, your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:

{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}

You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

If you see the following output, your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:

{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}

To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.html#migrating-to-multi-payload
