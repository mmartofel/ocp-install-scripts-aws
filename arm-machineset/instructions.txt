1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (oc).

2. You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:

oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"

If you see the following output, your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:

{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}

You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

If you see the following output, your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:

{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}

To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.html#migrating-to-multi-payload

Before migrating your single-architecture cluster to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, 
it is recommended to install the Multiarch Tuning Operator, and deploy a ClusterPodPlacementConfig custom resource.
For more information, see "Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator

Verify that the RetrievedUpdates condition is True in the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) by running the following command:

oc get clusterversion/version -o=jsonpath="{.status.conditions[?(.type=='RetrievedUpdates')].status}"

If above returns True, migrate to the multi-architecture payload with following command:

oc adm upgrade --to-multi-arch

You can monitor the migration by running the following command:

oc adm upgrade

exmple of ongoing migration plan:

The migrations must be complete and all the cluster operators must be stable before you can add compute machine sets with different architectures to your cluster.
